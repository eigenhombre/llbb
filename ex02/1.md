While it may be "cheating" to use the LLVM toolchain, its IR is easily
generated using pretty much any programming language, and Babashka
provides the power of Clojure, fast start up speed, the REPL,
etc. making it a fun way to experiment with LLVM and toy languages.

The next step for this repository is to flesh out the Hello, World
example and move towards the direction of a simple toy language,
perhaps a purely arithmetic Forth or similar.
